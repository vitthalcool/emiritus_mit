                                    <p>For those who come to Bootcamp with an idea, you will have an opportunity to present your idea, garner support, and potentially organize a team around your idea should it be chosen to move ahead after the group voting. MIT Bootcamp is an accelerated dive into what entrepreneurship is all about -- from generating ideas to identifying ideal customers to launching a startup.</p>

                                    <p>Yes, Bootcampers have identified cofounders and launched many different startups from the Bootcamps. During the first three years of the residential Bootcamp programs, graduates raised over $70M in funding for ventures launched directly from Bootcamp. More broadly across the MIT ecosystem, MIT graduates have started over 33,000 active companies that generate over $1.2 trillion in annual revenue and employ over 3.3 million people, making MIT the 10th largest economy in the world.</p>
                                    <p>We expect many of you in the online Bootcamp will conceptualize and launch startups, identify cofounders, and identify funding options.</p>

However, there are some rules of engagement for this community, which will be shared with all registered participants. You can connect and communicate with other participants through our online learning platform and form interest groups or location-specific groups and interact among those groups.

                                    <p>Based on feedback from the first cohort of participants, a solo track option was added. However we expect the majority of participants will join the traditional group-based approach. Here are some differences:</p>
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>In the solo track, you work on your own startup idea or business with intense focus. In the group track, ideas are voted on first by the group, and the winning idea moves ahead.</li>
                                        <li>All Bootcamp participants receive coaching from MIT coaches, however for those taking the solo track, individual coaching sessions are offered whereas in the group track, the coaching session includes your team of 5 individuals, thus offering more opportunities for peer learning.</li>
                                        <li>Since you are working on your own idea in the solo track, you will do your own market research to understand the potential of your idea in the market. In the group track, you will conduct market research as a team, leveraging skills from the rest of the team to get further down the path of proof of concept.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>In short, if you are unsure which track is the best option for you, contact your program advisor who can help you decide and share some examples from previous programs.</p>

                                    <p>Our policy is that we want you to be completely certain that this is the right learning experience for you. To that end, the refund policy is that registered participants are entitled to a 100% refund if withdrawal is made within the first two weeks. Most programs start with week zero as a “set up” session, which does not count; withdrawal can be made within the first two weeks for a refund issued back to the original credit card. You may be responsible for admin/exchange fees from your bank.</p>
